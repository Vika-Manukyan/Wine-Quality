# Wine-Quality
It’s a well-established fact that age makes wine better – the older the wine, the better it will taste. However, age is not the only thing that determines a wine’s taste. Numerous factors determine the wine quality certification, including physicochemical tests such as alcohol quantity, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, density, and pH level, to name a few.
